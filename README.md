# GA and HC12
Repository contains a GA algorithm implementation (Genetic algorithm) and HC12 algorithm implementaion ([more info](https://doi.org/10.1080/10556788.2011.556826)). HC12 is a highly scalable optimisation algorithm based on Hill Climbing algorithm. Modification developed by Radomil Matousek at VUT Brno.


# How to
1. Download files and open them in Matlab
2. Run `main_ga.m` file for GA and `main_hc.m` for HC12. Use other files as Matlab objective functions (`fn` parameter).

You are fully responsible for any damage to humanity with this code. Peace.
